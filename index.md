## **4. Projects**

### *Project 1 : Predictive data science approaches for enhancing security in Niger*

#### Abstract: 
The Sahel region, including Niger, faces numerous security challenges, such as terrorism, insurgency, and organized crime. Addressing these threats requires proactive measures and effective resource allocation. This thesis proposes the application of predictive data science approaches to enhance security in Sahel and Niger. 

#### Objective: 
The main objective of this research is to develop predictive models and tools that leverage data science techniques to forecast security incidents, identify vulnerability hotspots, and optimize resource allocation for enhanced security in the Sahel region, with a specific focus on Niger.

PS : This is an ongoing project, whose final report, scenarios, conclusions and predictions will be published on December 10, 2023.

## **6. Camp Management Camp Coordination**

### *IOM Haiti (Port-au-Prince)*

I carried out a 2-and-a-half-month STA in Haiti (Port-au-Prince) to support the IOM office in Haiti as an Information Management Officer for the CCCM Cluster and the Shelter/NFI sector, with an integration of the Cash base process for IDPs. As a result, I helped to put in place information coordination strategies for the CCCM Cluster.

During this period, I demonstrated my managerial and coordination expertise in information management, data analysis, computer analysis, programming languages, and teamwork. I have also supported the implementation of information management strategies and systems in all projects.
